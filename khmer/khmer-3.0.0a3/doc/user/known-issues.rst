Known Issues
============

- ``load-graph.py`` in multithreaded mode will find slightly different number of
  unique kmers. This is being investigated in
  https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/issues/1248

- Any scripts that consume FASTA or FASTQ data are unresponsive to attempts to
  terminate the program with ``ctrl-c``. Eventually khmer should handle this
  properly, but for now it should be possible to halt a script using ``ctrl-\``.
  This is being tracked in https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/issues/1618.
