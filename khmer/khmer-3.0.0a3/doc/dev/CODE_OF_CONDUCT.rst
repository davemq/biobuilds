Contributor Code of Conduct
===========================

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect
all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature
requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches,
and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of
experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
disability, personal appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of
sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks,
trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional
conduct.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project
maintainers or contributors who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be
removed from the project team.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may
be reported by emailing `khmer-project@idyll.org
<mailto:khmer-project@idyll.org>`__ which only goes to C. Titus Brown and
Michael R. Crusoe. To report an issue involving either of them please email
`Judi Brown Clarke, Ph.D. <mailto:jbc@egr.msu.edu>`__ the Diversity Director
at the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action, an NSF Center for
Science and Technology.
