about:
    description: 'UIDs are 128 bit numbers which are intended to have a high likelihood
        of uniqueness

        over space and time and are computationally difficult to guess. They are globally
        unique

        identifiers which can be locally generated without contacting a global registration
        authority.

        UUIDs are intended as unique identifiers for both mass tagging objects with
        an extremely

        short lifetime and to reliably identifying very persistent objects across
        a network.
