  summary: Reimplementations of functions introduced since R 3.0.0
  description: |
    Implementations of functions which have been introduced in R since version
    3.0.0. The backports are conditionally exported which results in R
    resolving the function names to the version shipped with R (if available)
    and uses the implemented backports as fallback. This way package developers
    can make use of the new functions without worrying about the minimum
    required R version.
